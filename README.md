NativeScript boilerplate for communicating with WordPress API

## Description

This is a small boilerplate of NativeScript application that I will be using in mobile app projects that need communicating with
WordPress API. It's also a good starting point to learn basics of NativeScript application development and communication with 
WordPress API.

This is still in development, but you are free to use it in your project. Contributions are also most welcomed! :)
